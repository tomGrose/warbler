# warbler

A project where I was given an application that was missing some functionality. 

I was in charge of:

Logout functionality.
Changing the HTML using jinja to display users information on their profiles.
Writing functionality to query the SQL database to display the correct "warbles"
Adding functionality for a user to like a "warble".
Adding tests to test view functions and SQL Alchemy models.
Adding functionality for user's to change their password.
Added functionality for a user to change their profile info.
